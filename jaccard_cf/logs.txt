-Using User-based
-Candidate similiarity metrics: Jaccard, Pearson, Cosine, Euclid

-Using Jaccard for similiarity matrix. 
  -Data is binary (0, 1), so Pearson and Cosine not suitable.
  -Jaccard calculates |Intersection| / |Union|, which fits our need for checking the similarity of user-item relations between users. 
-Scoring Metric: Whether the first k nearest neighbors contain more 0s or 1s for a given row/column.
