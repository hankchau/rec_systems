Implementations of Recommender Systems
## Collaborative Filtering
- Jaccard CF:
    - Uses Jaccard similarity as metric for a KNN-based collaborative filtering model.
## Multilayer Perceptrons 
- MLP:
    - Uses embedding layers and a multilayer perceptron to find latent features of dimension k for recommendation.
## General Matrix Factorization 
- GMF:
    - Uses embedding layers with Dot Product operation to find latent features of dimension k for recommendation.
## Neural Matrix Factorization 
- NeuMF:
    - Combines MLP and GMF models into a hybrid neural network for recommendation.
